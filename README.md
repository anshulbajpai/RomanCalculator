Reading Roman numerals
     
     
      Based on seven symbols
      I = 1
      V = 5
      X = 10
      L = 50
      C = 100
      D = 500
      M = 1000
     
      Numbers are formed by combining symbols together and adding the values.
     
      Symbols are placed from left to right in order of value, starting with the largest.
      However, in a few specific cases,[2] to avoid four characters being repeated in succession
      (such as IIII or XXXX) these can be reduced using subtractive notation as follows:
     
      -> The numeral I can be placed before V and X to make 4 units (IV) and 9 units (IX) respectively
      -> X can be placed before L and C to make 40 (XL) and 90 (XC) respectively
      -> C can be placed before D and M to make 400 and 900 according to the same pattern
     
      Examples
          
      II = 2
      IV = 4
      VIII = 8
      IX = 9
      XVI = 16
      XXXII = 32
      LXIV = 64
      XC = 90
      CXXVIII = 128
      CCLVI = 256
      DXII = 512
      CM = 900
      MXXIV = 1024
      MDCLXVI = 1666
